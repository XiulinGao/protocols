# Lab clean-up tasks on May 6th

* Field work gear reorganization, relabeled and box clean-up

This is mainly about preparing gear for coming field work, include:

   1. camping gear organization. We need to put all the camping gear in certain orders at certain place being labeled. Some of the camping gear, such as tarp, containers.
   2. kitchen tools clean-up and check for things that need to buy new or more. We need to clean those two boxes for storing the dry food and kitchen tools.
   3. Gear box, need to make sure it is organized with basic field gear which is necessary for all the trips. This is the link to basic gears:

* Tool storing drawers re-label and organization

This is for organizing tools and putting them in right drawer with right label on it, since some tools now actually stored in the wrong place with wrong label on it. 

* Hydraulic project associated organization

Since the stuff for hydraulic project are still hanging around in the lab without a good organization, this need to be solved. But how to solve this need to ask Dr.Schwilk.

* Organization in the back

Actually, the back is not bad, but probably still need to put away something that is not used anymore,or do some reorganization to maintain a god shape.

* Office supply organization

I ordered some new office supply two weeks ago, if they already arrived in the lab, we need to put them on the shelf for storing office supplies, and label them in right way.

* Meeting room organization

Meeting room now is not in bad shape, I almost clean them up every week since one month ago. However, 
we probably need to figure out how to deal with those samples, especially samples that out of date and won't be useful anymore. 

*NOTE*: Please let me know if you think anything else we need to take care of during this lab clean-up, thus I can add them into the list.
